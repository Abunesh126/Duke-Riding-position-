TM Smart Rider Posture Project – Summary

This project focuses on improving rider safety and ergonomics for KTM bikes using AI-based posture detection. A dashcam attached near the speedometer continuously monitors the rider’s sitting position and driving style. The trained AI model analyzes the footage in real time to:

Detect whether the rider is sitting properly or not

Warn the rider instantly if the posture is incorrect

Promote correct riding habits for comfort and safety

By combining computer vision, AI, and real-time alerts, the system ensures a smarter, safer, and more ergonomic riding experience.
